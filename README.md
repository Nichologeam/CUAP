### Casualties: Unknown/Scav Prototype Archipelago

This mod is made for the 4.1 version of Casualties: Unknown, which can be downloaded from the game's [Itch page](https://orsonik.itch.io/scav-prototype). Make sure you download V4.1 and not V5PreTesting4. V5 will only get support when it exits testing.

# **Setup Guide**
1. Download BepInEx v5.4 from its [Github Page](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.4).
2. Extract the zip folder into the game's directory
    - If done correctly, a BepInEx folder should appear.
3. Launch Casualties Unknown once to configure BepInEx
    - If done correctly, a Plugins folder should appear in the BepInEx folder.
4. Download and install the client mod by extracting the CUAPClientModx.x.x.zip folder into the newly created Plugins folder.
	- If done correctly, a CUAP folder should appear.
2. Download the APWorld and place it in the custom_worlds folder of your Archipelago install
3. Download the .yaml file attached and fill out your desired settings
4. Generate a multiworld and host a server.
5. Launch the game normally and click past the introductory story.
6. In the top right, enter the room connection information.
	- If you want to run with Deathlink, click the 'Deathlink' button.
	- If you don't, click 'connect'.
7. I recommend also connecting a text client, as Experiment is known to skip out on saying the item receive dialogue sometimes.
	- Item receive dialogues are also limited to the same rules as normal dialogue, where having impaired speech, brain damage, or being Hollow can change how text looks or remove it altogether.
8. If anything goes wrong while playing, please let me know. This is still in very early development and isn't anywhere near stable.

# **Sending Chat Messages**

Despite its limited functionality, you can send chat messages and chat commands. Open the in-game debug console with ` and start your command with 'talk '. Everything after the space will be sent as a chat message, including any commands like '!hint'. Note that there is no way to see incoming chat messages, so you will need a text client or another player to tell you.
