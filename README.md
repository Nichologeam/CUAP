### Casualties: Unknown/Scav Prototype Archipelago

This mod is made for the 4.0.1 version of Casualties: Unknown, which is currently the latest version on the game's [Itch page](https://orsonik.itch.io/scav-prototype). Make sure this is the version of the game you have before continuing.

# **Setup Guide**
1. Download and install the client mod by extracting the CUAPClientModx.x.x.zip folder into the game's directory.
	- If done correctly, a BepInEx folder should appear.
2. Download the APWorld and place it in the custom_worlds folder of your Archipelago install
3. Download the .yaml file attached and fill out your desired settings
4. Generate a multiworld and host a server.
5. Launch the game normally and click past the introductory story.
6. In the top right, enter the room connection information.
	- If you want to run with Deathlink, click the 'Deathlink' button.
	- If you don't, just click 'connect'.
7. I recommend also connecting a text client, as Experiment is known to skip out on saying the item receive dialog sometimes.
	- Item receive dialogs also are limited to the same rules as normal dialog, where having impaired speech, brain damage, or being Hollow can change how text looks or remove it altogether.
8. If anything goes wrong while playing, please let me know. This is still in very early development and isn't anywhere near stable.

# **Sending Chat Messages**

Despite its limited functionality, you can send chat messages and chat commands. Open the in-game debug console with ` and start your command with 'talk '. Everything after the space will be sent as a chat message, including any commands like '!hint'. Note that there is no way to see incoming chat messages, so you will need a text client or another player to tell you.
