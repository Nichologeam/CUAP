### Casualties: Unknown/Scav Prototype Archipelago

This mod is made for the V5PreTesting4 version of Casualties: Unknown, which can be downloaded from the game's [Itch page](https://orsonik.itch.io/scav-prototype). Make sure you download V5PreTesting4 and not V4.1.
To play the V4 version of this mod, download CUAP v0.3.1. Everything after that is V5PreTesting4.

# **Setup Guide**
1. Download BepInEx v5.4.23.3 from its [Github Page](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.3)
2. Extract the zip folder into the game's directory
    - If done correctly, a BepInEx folder should appear
3. Launch Casualties Unknown once to configure BepInEx
    - If done correctly, a Plugins folder should appear in the BepInEx folder
4. Download and install the client mod by extracting the CUAPClientModx.x.x.zip folder into the newly created Plugins folder
	- If done correctly, a CUAP folder should appear (not CUAPClientModx.x.x)
5. Download [Archipelago 0.6.4](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/tag/0.6.4) or newer
6. Download the APWorld and place it in the custom_worlds folder of your Archipelago install
7. Download the .yaml file attached and fill out your desired settings, then place it in the Players folder of your Archipelago install
8. Open Archipelago and select 'Generate'
9. Upload the .zip file in the Output folder to [the Archipelago website](https://archipelago.gg/uploads) to host
	- Alternatively, you can host on your own PC by selecting 'Host' in the Archipelago Launcher
10. Launch the game normally and enter the room connection information in the top right
	- If you want to run with Deathlink, click the 'Deathlink' button
	- If you don't, click 'connect'
11. I recommend also connecting a text client, as Experiment is known to skip out on saying the item receive dialogue sometimes
    - To do this, open the 'Text Client' in the Archipelago Launcher
12. If anything goes wrong while playing, please let me know. This is still in very early development and isn't anywhere near stable

# **Sending Chat Messages**

Despite its limited functionality, you can send chat messages and chat commands. Open the in-game debug console with ` and start your command with 'talk '. Everything after the space will be sent as a chat message, including any commands like '!hint'. Note that there is no way to see incoming chat messages, so you will need a text client or another player to tell you.
